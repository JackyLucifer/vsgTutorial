**Currently being written.**

This second part of the tutorial introduce developers to foundational classes and features that the rest of the VulkanSceneGraph classes are built upon. The topic is broken down into the following sections:

1. [vsg::ref_ptr<> & vsg::Object base class](Object_base_class_and_ref_ptr.md) - strong smart pointer with intrusive reference counting
1. [vsg::observer_ptr<>](observer_ptr.md) - weak smart pointers
1. [Maths Types](MathsTypes.md) - GLSL style data types
1. [Data Types](DataTypes.md) - vsg::Value, Array etc.
1. [Meta Data](MetaData.md) - how to use meta data
1. [vsg::Allocator](Allocator.md) - Block memory allocation for good performance
1. [MathsFunctions](MathFunctionss.md) - maths functions
1. [Visitors](Visitors.md) - type safe visiting and traversal
1. [IO](IO.md) - built-in serialization and and reading/writing data
