**Currently being written.**

This second part of this tutorial introduces developers to foundational classes and features that the rest of the VulkanSceneGraph classes are built upon. We start with introducing the base class and smart pointers, the vector and matrix types, the data containers and meta data.

1. [vsg::ref_ptr<> & vsg::Object base class](Object_base_class_and_ref_ptr.md) - strong smart pointer with intrusive reference counting
1. [vsg::observer_ptr<>](observer_ptr.md) - weak smart pointers
1. [Math Types](MathTypes.md) - GLSL style data types
1. [Data Types](DataTypes.md) - vsg::Value, Array, Array2D & Array3D
1. [Metadata](Metadata.md) - how to use metadata
1. [RTTI and Visitors](Visitors.md) - type safe visiting and traversal
1. [IO](IO.md) - built-in serialization and and reading/writing data
1. [Math Functions](MathFunctionss.md) - math functions
1. [vsg::Allocator](Allocator.md) - Block memory allocation for good performance
